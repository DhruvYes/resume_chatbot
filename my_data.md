## Projects

Below is a project that demonstrates my current programming skills. More projects are available on my GitHub as I continue to build them.



#### Project: Random-Gambles (A Number Guessing Game)

Description: As my first personal project, I developed a classic number-guessing game. The program generates a random number within a set range, and the player attempts to guess it.



Tech Stack: Python (utilizing the 'random' module for core logic).



Key Achievement: This project was an excellent introduction to core programming concepts in Python. It taught me how to implement user input, conditional logic (if/else statements), and loops, which are fundamental skills for any developer.
